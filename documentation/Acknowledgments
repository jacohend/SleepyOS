I followed several tutorials to complete this assignment.

I would not have been able to make this work if I had programmed all of the C library and memory functions from scratch, although the memory and interrupt code includes far more original "puzzling it out" on my part.

Basic C libraries for X86 hobby kernel development are all virtually identical. 
I visited OSdev, James Molloy's kernel development site, Bran's kernel tutorial, and Wikipedia, and found similar code for the boot asm, GDT/IDT, and C libraries. 
Because these are the only comprehensive sources I have, and because basic x86 boot asm and interrupt enabling, state saving, etc is all identical, my code will inevitably look similar if not the same, so I wish to attribute the relevant library code to their respective sources (although I do not use the term "authors" since most of this does not represent original material on the sources' part) to avoid accusations of plagiarism.  

I wrote the monitor code in summer 2008 using osdev tutorials as sources

I learned
boot asm from Molloy
linker from OSdev
GDT from Bran's tutorial
IDT, irqs, paging, vfs from Molloy, osdev
basic elf loading, task switching from skelix, Molloy

I modified or reimplemented many of these for my own purposes.
